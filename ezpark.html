                    <p>We aim to serve UW and matriculated UW students who commute to campus everyday, <br>
                        or keep their vehicles/ bikes on campus, and make it easier for these students to find <br>
                        free and/or affordable parking located around their classrooms. Students should not have <br>
                        to worry about paying an excessive amount for parking.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Expensive parking creates campus accessibility and transportation barriers, and financial <br>
                        burdens that stem from those barriers such as an extra barrier for education on top of <br>
                        tuition and housing for underprivileged students from low income households, international <br>
                        students who are paying more for tuition and receive no financial aid, and students from <br>
                        other colleges who are taking UW classes.

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>After doing in-depth research and ideating, we created a mobile app that will help <br>
                        students save money and decrease stress on parking. They could use the money to help <br>
                        support what they need for school like textbooks, tuition, supplies, and other technology <br>
                        needs. It can also lower stress for students when it comes to parking, students can <br>
                        then focus their time on things that are more important to them.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>We used research methods such as doing stakeholder interviews, and surveying the community. <br>
                We did interviews with a student that commutes to campus, and also we interviewed UW staff <br>
                on how they think about parking at the UW. Then we found that the student user’s average time <br>
                spent looking for parking is between 7  to 10 minutes. Based on the response, the user does <br>
                not have a pleasant experience dealing with parking on campus, they expressed emotions like <br>
                frustration and confusion. As for the UW staff, their response was that the parking has not <br>
                only students affected by parking. Staff is also showing great concern. When we did the survey, <br>
                we found that of the total number of 28 students, 64% spent between 5 to 15 minutes looking for <br>
                parking. While 16% spend 3 to 5 minutes and 12% spend 30 or more minutes looking for parking. <br>
