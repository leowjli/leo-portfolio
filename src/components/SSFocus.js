          Interactions between international students and native English speakers are often difficult or not memorable. The slang we use in daily conversations is too unfamiliar to international students who are taught formal English, which leads to a more hidden language barrier that should be addressed to improve the communicaition experience.

            We conducted surveys and interviews of international students to design a slang-learning mobile app that introduces the latest used slang to assist in the understanding of everyday English slang, encouraging cultural integration, community connection, and making conversations between students more memorable.
