                    <p>We aim to serve UW and matriculated UW students who commute to campus everyday,
                        or keep their vehicles/ bikes on campus, and make it easier for these students to find 
                        free and/or affordable parking located around their classrooms. Students should not have 
                        to worry about paying an excessive amount for parking.

                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <p>Expensive parking creates campus accessibility and transportation barriers, and financial 
                        burdens that stem from those barriers such as an extra barrier for education on top of 
                        tuition and housing for underprivileged students from low income households, international 
                        students who are paying more for tuition and receive no financial aid, and students from 
                        other colleges who are taking UW classes.

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>After doing in-depth research and ideating, we created a mobile app that will help 
                        students save money and decrease stress on parking. They could use the money to help 
                        support what they need for school like textbooks, tuition, supplies, and other technology 
                        needs. It can also lower stress for students when it comes to parking, students can 
                        then focus their time on things that are more important to them.

            <h1>Research</h1>
            <div id="overview">
                <p>We used research methods such as doing stakeholder interviews, and surveying the community. 
                    We did interviews with a student that commutes to campus, and also we interviewed UW staff 
                    on how they think about parking at the UW. Then we found that the student user’s average time 
                    spent looking for parking is between 7  to 10 minutes. Based on the response, the user does 
                    not have a pleasant experience dealing with parking on campus, they expressed emotions like 
                    frustration and confusion. As for the UW staff, their response was that the parking has not 
                    only students affected by parking. Staff is also showing great concern. When we did the survey, 
                    we found that of the total number of 28 students, 64% spent between 5 to 15 minutes looking for 
                    parking. While 16% spend 3 to 5 minutes and 12% spend 30 or more minutes looking for parking.

            <h1>Moodboard</h1>
            <p>The main stakeholders was UW students and staff and we wanted to bring out the joy in accessible
                parking, so we bounced our ideas on the moodboard, playing with different themes. <br>

            <h1>User Personas</h1>
            <p>Our targeted direct stakeholders are UW students and staff who needs to drive to
                campus daily, and need a smooth transition from parking to working or studying.
            </p>
            <p>Our indirect stakeholders would be people like transportation services who don't
                need to use the app everyday but would be useful to know the traffic around them,
                and better assist with transportation.<br>
