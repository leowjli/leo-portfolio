          <h3>Problem</h3>
          <p>
            Expensive parking creates campus accessibility and transportation barriers, and financial burdens that stem from those barriers such as an extra barrier for education on top of tuition and housing for underprivileged students from low income households, international students who are paying more for tuition and receive no financial aid, and students from other colleges who are taking UW classes.

          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            After doing in-depth research and ideating, we created a mobile app that will help students save money and decrease stress on parking. They could use the money to help support what they need for school like textbooks, tuition, supplies, and other technology needs. It can also lower stress for students when it comes to parking, students can then focus their time on things that are more important to them.
