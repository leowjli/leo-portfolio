                <h1>Great to meet you!</h1>
                <p>I’m Leo, a Sophomore studying informatics and computer-related topics 
                    at the University of Washington. I’m passionate about the design and 
                    coding processes that connects information and people, and strive to 
                    create new applications or designs that positively impacts the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I’m learning more code on my own and am diving deeper into UI/UX 
                Design. I’ve joined clubs that enhances my coding skills and worked with 
                peers creating projects that solve problems around campus.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of classes, I like to play basketball, toss a Frisbee, practice drumming, 
                eat good food, and listen to music.</p>

                    <h5>UI Design and User Research</h5>
                    <p>A mobile app prototype designed to tackle parking challenges around UW.  <br>
                        As a team, we conducted user research and derived specific questions <br>
                        targeted to the students and staff population at UW. I created lo-fi and<br>
                        high-fi of all screens of the app using Figma. We then presented a project<br>
                        pitch that talked about the features and usage of the application.
